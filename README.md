# Cliff shader
Cliff shader for s&box. https://asset.party/fish/cliffshader
Originally written when I was learning HLSL, then finished for My Summer Cottage game (Facepunch game jam winner!), and then polished for a public release. This code is probably far from good, but perhaps someone will find this useful. 

## What is this?
This is a simple cliff shader with triplanar mapping, texture layering & other features, which should provide artists enough flexibility to keep cliffs detailed enough at any scale. Texture layering can be done by providing an existing mask texture, or using a dynamic one.

For full list of features and other details, please see the asset.party link above.
